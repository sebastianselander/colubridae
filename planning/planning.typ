= Colubridae
\
$"Colubridae"^1$ is a compiler for a programming language inspired by the simplicity of Python.
However, Colubridae will also include a nominal type system, some type
inference, as well as being compiled to LLVM IR.
\
Some notable features (if time allows) of Colubridae will be:
- higher-order functions.
- algebraic data types
- arrays
A large focus of the project will be to develop the compiler using good
techniques for the future, e.g
#link("https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/11/trees-that-grow.pdf")[trees that grow],
#link("https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/lti-toplas.pdf")[bidirectional type checking]

To be considered a useful language I would argue that Colubridae needs a garbage collector, but unfortunately that is out of the scope of this project.

= Experiences
I'm just finished my fourth year studying computer science at Gothenburg
university. No previous programming experience prior to starting my university
studies. This is not the first compiler I make, however, all previous attempts
have resulted in compilers that I am not confident in whatsoever, thus this is something I would like to avoid this time.

= Techniques
I will be writing the compiler in Haskell, using some standard helpful
libraries such as: `lens`, `mtl`, `megaparsec`. I will use the LLVM IR library
as well if it still is maintained.

= Time plan

== Details
Followng is a list of that need to be implemented that I know of in advance:
- Parser
- Alpha renamer
- Typechecker
- Desugaring
- Internal intermediate language
- LLVM IR generation phase
More things will probably arise during development, but I can't think of anything else at the moment.

== Time plan
Total time available roughly: `8 * 40h`

The first month will be spent implementing the basics of the language. That is,
parsing, renaming, type checking, and code generating basic expressions and
statements. Unfortunately at this point I don't know exactly how long this will take.

I reckon roughly that the following is how my time will be spent:
- `3 * 40` on implementing the basics of the compiler
- `2 * 40` on implementing higher-order functions 
- `2 * 40` on implementing algebraic data types and pattern matching
- `1 * 40` on implementing arrays

Time will also be spent refactoring as well as I will make mistakes that need to be corrected for future additions to work.

Please reach out to me if anything is unclear!
